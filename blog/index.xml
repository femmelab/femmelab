      <description>This article is an excerpt from the integration paper (submitted March 2021) of Kara Medina for the Field Instruction Program (FIP) of the MA Women and Development Studies program of UP Diliman.
In its pilot internship program, Femme Lab recruited four undergraduate interns with backgrounds or experiences in public relations, film, graphic design, copywriting and content creation, broadcast communications, and research to support its active projects. For the majority of the interns, a semester-long internship is a requirement for graduation and their schools ensure compliance through regular reporting of hours completed and outputs submitted.</description>
